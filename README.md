The purpose of my project is to understand and implement open source software for my personal benefit and for the overall comprehension of the way OSS works.Right now, I'm not yet decided on the project but I've chosen to do something that involves physically building something that provides the user with information. 
One of the ideas I'm currently considering is a semi-transparent mirror with a raspberry pi built in and a display that will bleed through the mirror and give scrolling weather updates.
